# beldex-daemon-launcher

Integration of beldexd with belnet for Master Nodes



BUILD



`make` will build `launcher`



Goals

shell script or c/c++ program to facilitate the launching and validation of settings for beldexd and belnet



Allow config file


Allow command line options to override config file



Deployment platforms by priorty:

1. Linux

2. Windows

3. MacOS

4. RasPi



Building the binaries are out of scope, however I'll include some platforms scripts as we have them. Tough to support all distros.



TODO

- jsonrpc compatible params
